**Here's a small description of my two graphs**

## graph 1: US GDP
![US GDP](USA_GDP.png)

This Graph shows how the united states gdp has changed year by year. I used the X axis as the years. The y axis is the GDP of the US in Trillions of dollars.

## Graph 2: Narcos vs Westworld runtime
![Narcos vs Westworld runtime](Narcos_vs_westworld_runtime.png)

This Graph uses a line graph to compare the runtime per episode of Narcos and Westworld. The x axis is a count of the episodes. The Y axis is the runtime in minutes.
